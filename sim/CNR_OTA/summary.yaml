  Electrical verification of the top level bias block

  To run all simulations do `make all`

simulations:
  lstb:
    name: Loop stability analysis differential loop

      Uses Tian/Middelbrook to check the phase-margin of the CNR_OTA circuit

    data:
      - name: Sch_typ
        src: results/lstb_Sch_typical
        method: typical
      - name: Sch_etc
        src: results/lstb_Sch_etc
        method: minmax
      - name: Sch_std
        src: results/lstb_Sch_mc
        method: std
  lstbcmfb:
    name: Loop stability analysis common mode feedback loop
